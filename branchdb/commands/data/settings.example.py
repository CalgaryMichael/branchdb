"""
The 'DATABASES' setting is the only variable that must be set.
The variable should be a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary
declaring the appropriate engine and database authentication.

Please see the README for more information.

Example:
    DATABASES = [{
        "ENGINE": "postgres",
        "USER": "user",
        "PASSWORD": "password",
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "PORT": 5432
    }]
"""
DATABASES = []
